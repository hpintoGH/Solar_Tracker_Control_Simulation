# Project details

A comprehensive MATLAB/Simulink simulation framework for intelligent solar tracking systems using machine learning models to optimize photovoltaic panel positioning based on real-world weather data and solar radiation patterns.

## Overview

This repository contains a complete intelligent solar tracker control system that combines machine learning prediction models with Simulink simulation to control dual-axis solar tracking mechanisms. The system uses trained models (Random Forest and Deep Learning) to predict optimal panel positioning based on weather conditions and solar radiation data, providing an alternative to traditional astronomical sun-tracking methods.

## Key Features

The system implements machine learning-based tracking through two trained models designed for intelligent panel positioning that maximizes solar irradiance capture. The Random Forest model incorporates MRMR (Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy) feature selection to identify the most relevant weather variables for optimal positioning predictions, while the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture features four fully-connected layers that capture nonlinear relationships between atmospheric conditions and optimal panel angles.

Real-world data integration forms the foundation of the system through the comprehensive NSRDB (National Solar Radiation Database) dataset spanning 2018-2023, providing six years of high-resolution meteorological and solar radiation data. The simulation environment encompasses a complete Simulink model featuring NEMA 17 stepper motor control systems that represent the mechanical aspects of dual-axis solar tracking hardware.

Performance comparison tools utilize Python-based irradiance analysis through PVlib libraries, enabling detailed comparisons between machine learning predictions and traditional astronomical tracking methods. The location-specific training approach focuses on Daytona Beach, Florida conditions, selected arbitrarily within the United States due to the availability and accessibility of high-resolution temporal and spatial data necessary for robust model development. The system incorporates flexible solar position calculation capabilities through multiple algorithms, including NREL's Solar Position Algorithm (SPA) for precise astronomical calculations and Python PVlib integration for comprehensive irradiance modeling and validation.

# Simulation and Results

## Comparison Between the Random Forest Model and the MLP Deep Learning Model

The comparative analysis between Random Forest and MLP Deep Learning models for solar tracking prediction reveals Random Forest's superior performance across both azimuth and tilt predictions. Random Forest achieved exceptional accuracy with RÂ² values of 0.99998 for azimuth and 0.99889 for tilt, compared to Deep Learning's 0.99715 and 0.95567 respectively.

Random Forest demonstrated significantly lower error rates, with MSE values of 0.076 (azimuth) and 0.730 (tilt) versus Deep Learning's 13.629 and 29.179. The Mean Absolute Errors were also substantially lower: 0.196Â° vs 3.074Â° for azimuth, and 0.409Â° vs 2.572Â° for tilt.

The relatively low azimuth errors in both models likely stem from the fact that optimal azimuth calculated by PVlib closely resembles the predictable astronomical solar azimuth. The greater variation occurs in tilt angle, which must adapt to momentary conditions such as cloud cover and atmospheric changes, making it the more challenging parameter to predict accurately.

The performance difference suggests that Random Forest's ensemble approach and feature handling capabilities are particularly well-suited for solar tracking applications, providing more precise and reliable predictions than the deep learning alternative. The graph below compares the predicted values from each model with the actual target values for both azimuth and tilt angles.

### Solar Tracking Performance Analysis: Random Forest model vs SPA on Clear Sky Conditions

The comparative analysis of a Random Forest machine learning model against the Solar Position Algorithm (SPA) for solar tracking reveals remarkably similar performance metrics during the 13-hour daylight period analyzed on June 27, 2023, under clear sky conditions.

#### Performance Equivalence

Both tracking systems demonstrated nearly identical energy collection capabilities, with the ML model achieving 99.9% efficiency compared to the astronomical SPA method. The ML system generated 9.77 kWh/mÂ² versus 9.78 kWh/mÂ² for SPA, representing only a 0.1% difference in daily energy output. Both tracking systems significantly outperformed the baseline global horizontal irradiance (GHI) of 7.62 kWh/mÂ², with energy gains of 2.15 kWh/mÂ² (28.3%) and 2.17 kWh/mÂ² (28.5%) respectively.

#### Tracking Accuracy Trade-offs

While performance outcomes were equivalent, the tracking methodologies differed significantly. The SPA algorithm maintained superior positional accuracy with an average angle of incidence (AOI) of 2.0Â° compared to the ML model's 7.2Â°. The positional differences between the two systems showed a mean absolute error of 5.1Â° in tilt positioning and 0.6Â° in azimuth positioning, indicating that the ML model's largest deviations from SPA occur in the tilt axis.

#### Clear Sky Advantage for SPA

Under ideal sunny conditions, the astronomical SPA algorithm operates at optimal efficiency since direct solar radiation patterns are predictable and consistent. The absence of cloud interference allows precise sun positioning to maximize energy capture effectively. The ML model's ability to match this performance demonstrates its competence under clear sky scenarios, though the true advantage of machine learning approaches typically emerges under variable weather conditions where cloud movement and diffuse radiation patterns require adaptive tracking strategies.

#### Practical Implications

Despite reduced positional precision, the Random Forest model's ability to match SPA performance under clear sky conditions suggests that perfect astronomical tracking may not be necessary for optimal energy collection on sunny days. However, this analysis represents ideal conditions where SPA excels. The ML approach's tolerance for positioning errors while maintaining energy output indicates potential advantages in reduced mechanical complexity, though its true benefits would likely be more apparent during partially cloudy or variable weather conditions where adaptive tracking becomes crucial.

The graph below presents a comparison between solar tracking controlled by the Random Forest model and astronomical tracking, using data from a **sunny day**.

### Solar Tracking Performance Analysis: Random Forest model vs SPA on Cloudy Conditions

The comparative analysis on July 31, 2023, under cloudy conditions reveals a reversal in performance between the Random Forest machine learning model and the Solar Position Algorithm (SPA), demonstrating the adaptive advantages of ML-based tracking systems.

#### Machine Learning Superiority in Variable Conditions

Under cloudy skies, the ML model outperformed the astronomical SPA algorithm, achieving 109.4% efficiency compared to SPA. The ML system generated 4.59 kWh/mÂ² versus 4.50 kWh/mÂ² for SPA, representing a 2.0% energy advantage. More remarkably, while the ML model maintained a positive tracking gain of 0.9% over baseline GHI, the SPA system actually performed worse than horizontal irradiance with a -6.8% tracking loss.

#### Adaptive Tracking Under Diffuse Conditions

The ML model's success stems from its ability to optimize for diffuse radiation patterns rather than direct solar positioning. Despite maintaining large positional differences from SPA (25.8Â° mean absolute tilt error), the ML system's adaptive approach captured more available irradiance. The astronomical algorithm's precision in sun-tracking became counterproductive when cloud cover created predominantly diffuse lighting conditions.

#### Performance Implications

This analysis demonstrates that machine learning approaches excel in variable weather conditions where traditional astronomical tracking fails. The ML model's ability to adapt to changing irradiance patterns provides substantial advantages over rigid sun-following algorithms during cloudy periods.

The graph below presents a comparison between solar tracking controlled by the Random Forest model and astronomical tracking, using data from a **cloudy day**.

<img width="4770" height="3543" alt="ml_vs_astronomical_tracking_comparison" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d39fd723-f73c-4838-95b7-864e5ef0f31d" />

### Solar Tracking Performance Analysis: MLP Deep Learning model vs SPA on Clear Sky Conditions

<img width="4771" height="3543" alt="ml_vs_astronomical_tracking_comparison" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cc11903-821b-471f-ba08-23dca8dcaf3b" />

### Solar Tracking Performance Analysis: MLP Deep Learning model vs SPA on Cloudy Conditions

<img width="4770" height="3543" alt="ml_vs_astronomical_tracking_comparison" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9abb9b38-68b7-4b81-9ce4-aa56d710274e" />

## Comparison of energy storage on a cloudy day

<img width="2928" height="1502" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9cb25d8-1d30-411a-8cf4-27bbd3ff3154" />

Based on the simulation results for cloudy conditions, using machine learning for solar tracking yields a nearly identical battery SOC compared to the traditional SPA method, with only a 0.94% difference. This suggests little advantage in terms of stored energy under the simulated scenario. While this improvement may seem modest, it could become significant over long-term operation, in locations with frequent cloud cover, or when bifacial panels are used.

It is important to note that these findings are based on simulations, not real-world measurements. Factors such as sensor noise, shading variability, and system dynamics may affect actual performance. Therefore, while machine learning shows promising results and generalization potential, its practical benefits should be validated through field experiments. Overall, it can be considered a viable and potentially superior alternative to SPA under specific environmental conditions.
